**Full Stack Open Solutions**

This repository contains my solutions to the exercises from the University of Helsinki's [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) course. The course offers a comprehensive dive into modern web development, covering topics such as:

- **React**
- **Redux**
- **Node.js**
- **Express**
- **MongoDB**
- **GraphQL**
- **TypeScript**

Each part of the course is organized into separate directories, reflecting the structured progression through these technologies.

*Note: These solutions were developed during my learning journey and may not represent the only or optimal approach to the exercises.*
